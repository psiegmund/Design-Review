                    <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well
                        and where it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do
                        to make this design more efficient?”</p>

                <h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>
                <p class="standardText">Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be
                    improved but also make
                    revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                <h2>Design Report</h2>
                <p class="standardText">We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a
                    detailed visual report
                    with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
                </p>
                <h2>Ways to Redesign</h2>
                <p class="standardText">We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from
                    freelancers to
                    high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
                    and quick but effective improvements.</p>
